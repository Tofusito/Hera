# 🐾 Hera – Your Voice, Reimagined

![Hera Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150x150.png?text=Hera)

**Minimalist AI voice note app, lovingly inspired by a tuxedo cat named Hera.**  
Capture your thoughts. Summarize them effortlessly. Let your voice become action.

## ✨ What is Hera?

**Hera** is an iOS voice recording app that goes beyond just storing audio.  
It listens, thinks, and helps you organize your thoughts — all with the elegance and intuition of the cat who inspired it.

Yes, a cat.

Named after *Hera*, my tuxedo cat who’s been my quiet companion through chaos and calm, this app is a tribute to attention, presence, and clarity.

## 🐱 Why Hera?

Because building yet another notes app was *boring*.  
Hera was always listening when I wasn’t. Now, this app does the same.  
No ads. No noise. Just your voice, distilled into something useful — with a touch of feline clarity.

## ☕ Help Bring Hera to the App Store

Right now, Hera lives on my iPhone, like a secret productivity tool I can’t share.  
But I want to release it for **everyone** — minimalists, voice note addicts, anxious creatives, even dog people.

**Apple charges 99€ a year to join the developer program.**  
So I’m raising funds to make it happen.
